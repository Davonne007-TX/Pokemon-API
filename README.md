#Pokemon API Project

Welcome to Pokedex..!

Choose and select your Pokemon and see its details..!

Filled with promises, async/await, props, maps, filters, and all the javascript you can have. Or should we say JSX. I had fun building this project and excited to optimize it as I learn and develop my Frontend skills.
